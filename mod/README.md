# Overview

Have you ever noticed that the notification events when other empires adopt the Psionics tradition group or "Great Awakening" tradition each indicate that members of the Latent/Fully Psionic species manifest abilities _regardless_ of their current empire?  Have you _also_ noticed how members of that species in your empire don't actually gain the Latent Psionic trait?  Then this mod is for you!  Now, every Pop and leaders of the same species as the main species of the empire that adopted the Psionics tradition group or "Great Awakening" tradition will gain the Latent Psionic or Psionic species trait (respectively).

# Changes

The notification event when another empire adopts the Psionics tradition group ends with

> The \<Psionics adopter main species\> population within our borders have **_begun exhibiting similar changes as well,_** so whatever is happening to their species is **_not localized to any single region of space_**" [emphases added]

and the notification for empires adopting the "Great Awakening" tradition mentions that

> "**_All \<Awakened main species\> throughout the galaxy have undergone a great change._** Whereas before their latent psionic power had only blossomed in a small minority, the entire species has now unlocked its full psychic potential. Although these changes seem to have originated in the \<Awakened empire\>, **_they have now manifested in all members of their species regardless of where they reside_**" [emphasis added]

This mod does exactly what this original-to-the-game text says: any members of the newly Latent Psionic or Psionic species gain the appropriate species traits regardless of which empire controls them.

## Compatibility

Preempts the `utopia.2600` event that is responsible for the initial species upgrade with the Latent Psionic trait and `utopia.2650` event that is responsible for the initial species upgrade with the Psionic trait.  That means this mod is likely to conflict with other mods that want to alter the conversion process for normal -> latent psionic and/or latent psionic -> psionic.

Mods altering or allowing assimilation/ascension with different conditions aren't always a conflict.

Built for Stellaris version 3.8 "Gemini."  Not compatible with achievements.

### When to Install

This mod can be safely added to or removed from your savegame after the game has started.  It is implemented through events without adding or removing gameplay objects.  If you remove it, you will keep any modified species and leaders of those species with their existing traits, but further empires adopting Psionics traditions group or the "Great Awakening" tradition will only upgrade their own Pops and leaders.  Back up your savegame before trying to remove a mod.

### Required Mod Dependencies

[Leader Traits: All Eligible Species Traits](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2499031295) - this mod ensures your leaders always gain the correct leader traits (such as Psionic) and contains a minor enhancement that leaders of _any_ Latent Psionic species have a chance to manifest full Psionic powers and gain the appropriate leader trait. This was previously restricted to occur for leaders that are both Latent Psionic and the same species as the empire's founder species.

### Recommended Companion Mods

* [Assimilate All the Pops](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2908463208) allows empires to have multiple assimilation types, and thus cybernetic species can also gain psionic traits
* [Deassimilate Machines](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553812372) contains much of my assimilation enhancements, required for Assimilate All the Pops

## Known Issues

This mod overwrites preempts two events from the base game.  Expect to see two lines in error.log like this:

```
[22:28:14][eventmanager.cpp:368]: an event with id [utopia.2600] already exists!  file: events/utopia_on_action_events.txt line: 1329
[22:28:14][eventmanager.cpp:368]: an event with id [utopia.2650] already exists!  file: events/utopia_on_action_events.txt line: 1588
```

### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.
